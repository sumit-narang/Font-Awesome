2.I found this thing "Font Awesome" which is really awesome in the sense that it provides
icons which can be included in the project, it is scalable so we don't have to worry about
the icons getting pixalated.

4.We can vist  http://fontawesome.io/
5.There is a cheat sheet which comes with it.
6.We can copy the image and open in illustrator or PS and modify it.
