1.I'm going to add to github whatever i find new
2.I found this thing "Font Awesome" which is really awesome in the sense that it provides
icons which can be included in the project, it is scalable so we don't have to worry about
the icons getting pixalated.
3.There are different ways to include this in our project.
4.We can vist  http://fontawesome.io/
5.There is a cheat sheet which comes with it.
6.We can copy the image and open in illustrator or PS and modify it.
7.Install the .ttf file in the fonts folder.
8.copy the icon from the cheat sheet and open in PS or illustrator and change the font in them to font awesome.
